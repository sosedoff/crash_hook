# CrashHook

CrashHook is a rack middleware for handling exception in your rack-based application.

It sends a http request with exception information, backtrace and environment details to your url via specified method.

## Installation

    gem install crash_hook

## Usage

In Rails 3 apps:

``` ruby
YOUR_RAILS_APP::Application.config.middleware.use CrashHook::Middleware, {
  :url => 'YOUR_URL'
}
```

You can add any exceptions into ignore list:

``` ruby
YOUR_RAILS_APP::Application.config.middleware.use CrashHook::Middleware, {
  :url => 'YOUR_URL',
  :ignore => [
    'NoMethodError'
  ]
}
```

In other rack apps (config.ru):

``` ruby
require 'crash_hook'

use CrashHook::Middleware {
  :url => 'YOUR_URL',
  :method => :post
}
```
    
## Options

You can use these options during configuration:

- :url    &mdash; Target URL (**required**)
- :method &mdash; Request method *(default: :post)*
- :params &mdash; Extra parameters for the request *(ex.: api key, app ID, etc.)*
- :format &mdash; Report format (:form, :json), *(default: json)*
- :ignore &mdash; Array of exception class names you want to ignore, *(default: [])*
- :logger &mdash; Set a logger for delivery errors, *(default: nil)*
